# SQL-Task
This repository contains SQL scripts to create and manage a simple e-commerce database.

Database Structure

The database consists of three main tables:

customers

* id (Primary Key, Auto-Increment): Unique identifier for each customer
* name: Customer's name
* email: Customer's email address
* address: Customer's address

products

* id (Primary Key, Auto-Increment): Unique identifier for each product
* name: Product's name
* price: Product's price
* description: Product's description
* discount: Optional discount applied to the product

orders

* id (Primary Key, Auto-Increment): Unique identifier for each order
* customer_id (Foreign Key referencing customers.id): Customer who placed the order
* order_date: Date the order was placed
* total_amount: Total amount of the order

How to Use

* Create the Database:
Execute the ecommerce.sql script in your MySQL environment to create the database and tables.

* Run the Queries:
The ecommerce.sql script contains various SQL queries to analyze and manipulate the data. You can execute these queries directly in your MySQL client.

Database Optimization:

* Appropriate indexes to improve query performance.
* Consider normalization to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.

Additional Considerations

* Security: Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive customer data.
* Scalability: Design the database to handle increasing data volumes and user traffic.
* Performance: Optimize database queries and indexes for efficient data retrieval.
